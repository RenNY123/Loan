# Loan
This is a project with data from Lending Club.
Different features are extracted and analyzed. 
We trained different classification models from random forest to logistic regression to get a good prediction of loan default.
After stacking different models, we achieved 67% accuracy and 68% recall rate on this imbalanced data.
